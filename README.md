Code Jam IDE
============

This is the tool I use for Code Jam.

Try it online [here](http://joseprio.github.io/codejamide/ide.html).

More information about it can be found in [an article in my blog](http://www.joseprio.com/blog/2012/05/26/using-javascript-in-google-code-jam/).

Makes use of Tom Wu's excellent BIGINT JS library and the Ajax.org ACE editor.
